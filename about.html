            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was young, I was fascinated by the world of engineering, whether it was mechanical, electrical, chemical, etc. The idea that there were multiple steps that need to build up on each other to achieve a simple goal is so astonishing. I am now an Electrical Engineering Major in LSU and do CS on my own time for fun.</p>
